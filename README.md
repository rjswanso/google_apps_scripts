# Google Apps Scripts for Educational Workflows

While I was a teacher, there was a lot of ineffiencies. I wrote these scripts to remove those inefficiencies or to create improved educational workflows. Below you can find some descriptions of each.

## Agenda Slide Mover

I created agenda slides for each class to know what they were doing each day, what work was involved with links, and deadlines. This was created to be automatically triggered each morning to move already created agenda slides to that day's agenda presentation for student access. 

## Assessment Tools

This creates a menu item that repopulates randomly generated student data related to a data analysis problem, and then emails the student data to each student for a unique problem solving experience. Assessments are time consuming to create and require mathematical precision and accuracy to ensure no mistakes are made. 

## Class Calendar Scheduler

This pulls from an existing calendar template created by admin and populates a user's calendar with events with selected names and colors between a certain time period (a semester). 

## Google Drive Auditor

This was written to document any Google Drive files that are publicly shared to better organize and manage a large google drive. It emails the user with provided files that are publicly shared.

## Google Drive Migrator

This script transfers ownership of files by copying files while logged in with another domain's email. 

## Letter of Recommendation Creator

This uses a template and takes form data to populate a google doc with provided information. The form provides useful adjectives and a questioning structure to help organize the letter.

## Personal File Copy

This is just a simple file copy app that I created for my coworkers to help them with copying files/folders.
